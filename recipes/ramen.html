    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>¼ cup gochujang paste (80 g)</li>
        <li>⅓ cup less salt soy sauce (80 ml)</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon sugar</li>
        <li>3 inch ginger, sliced</li>
        <li>6 garlic cloves , bruised & peeled</li>
        <li>4 cup chicken stock (1 liter)</li>
        <li>8 dry shiitake mushrooms</li>
        <li>1 can coconut milk</li>
        <li>2 tablespoon butter (30 g)</li>
    </ul>


    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Mix everything well in a small bowl. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Add all ingredients, including broth flavouring into a huge pot. Bring to a simmer, cover the pot with a lid
            and cook for 30 minutes or until the shiitake mushrooms have soften. Meanwhile, lets proceed with the
            chicken katsu.</li>
        <li>Once broth's ready, scoop out shiitake, ginger and garlic. Discard ginger and garlic. Slice shiitake, set
            aside.</li>
        <li>Season the chicken well with salt and pepper. Crack the egg in a deep plate, sprinkle with some salt and
            whisk. In a flat plate, mix panko, bread crumbs and sesame seeds.</li>
        <li>Line chicken, egg, breading mixture and another flat plate. Grab a chicken with one hand and coat it in the
            egg. Then place on the breading mixture. With another hand, cover chicken with breading, pressing as you go
            so that it sticks. Flip and do the same. Place in an empty plate. Repeat until you finish all the chicken
            pieces. Spray some oil in the air fryer inner rack. Place the chicken in and spray the top with a bit more
            oil. Use "Air fry" mode, set temperature to 400ºF (200ºC) and cook for 16 minutes. Remove and set aside for
            late.</li>
        <li>Topping and assemble.</li>
    </ol>
