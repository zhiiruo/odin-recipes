    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>End of summer means no more deliveries of fresh vegetables and fruits from my dad’s garden. It is sad to wake up
        on a Monday morning and not look forward to a surprise.</p>

    <p>Right after the weekend they closed our summerhouse for the season, my dad brought a crate full of tiny
        pomegranates, each the size of a large lemon. Underneath their bright yellow/pink skin were the sweetest seeds I
        have ever tasted. Instead of popping the seeds in my mouth one by one, I squeezed their juice and turned them
        into a frozen yogurt. </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups freshly-squeezed pomegranate juice</li>
        <li>1+ 1/2 cup plain, whole milk yogurt</li>
        <li>2/3 cup Grenadine (pomegranate syrup)</li>
        <li>1/2 cup sugar</li>
        <li>2 tsp lemon juice</li>
    </ul>


    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Stir pomegranate juice and sugar over moderate heat until the sugar dissolves. Add lemon juice and let cool
            to room temperature.</li>
        <li>In a bowl, combine yogurt, pomegranate juice and pomegranate syrup and whisk until completely combined.</li>
        <li>Chill the mixture thoroughly (3 hours in the freezer works for me), then freeze it in your ice cream machine
            according to the manufacturer’s instructions. If you don’t have one, here’s how you make ice cream without a
            machine.</li>
    </ol>
